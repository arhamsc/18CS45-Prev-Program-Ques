/*The Object class in Java has three final methods that allow threads to communicate about the 
locked status of a resource. 
i. wait()

It tells the calling thread to give up the lock and go to sleep until some other thread enters the same 
monitor and calls notify(). The wait() method releases the lock prior to waiting and reacquires the 
lock prior to returning from the wait() method.*/
